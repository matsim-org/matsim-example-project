/**
 * Examples are collected in the package {@link tutorial}, in particular {@link tutorial.programming}.  They sit physically in the
 * matsim main repository, not on the matsim-example-project on which you are working here.  However, maven should be configured
 * such that it downloads the matsim sources as well, so you should be able to click on the package links above.  (In eclipse, this seems
 * to be a bit flaky; in many cases, it works if you say "attach source", then start browsing around, and then it often pops up without 
 * you having to know where it is physically located.)
 * <br/><br/>
 * An alternative (in eclipse): Your package explorer should have "Maven Dependencies", open that, and further matsim-0.X.Y.jar --> 
 * tutorial --> programming .  If you have the source attachments, then you can look through code there.
 * <br/><br/>
 * A further alternative: "Open Type", and then Run* ; many examples are Run*Example.
 * <br/><br/>
 * In any case, it should <i>not</i> be necessary to explicitly download the MATSim main code.  We are not against that, we just think
 * that it is easier to rely on the maven mechanics since in particular this guarantees that the versions are consistent.
 * <br/><br/>
 * Please let us know if this works for you or not.
